                <p>As a child I dressed up my barbie dolls and arranged them like models. 
It pains me to think how much film my parents paid for to be developed, 
only to find out I’d run rampage as a make-belief fashion photographer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My passion for photography did not dwindle with age so upon finishing school 
I studied film & photography at the School of Visual Arts on Mallorca. 
My main love was always for portraits and photo journalism. 
I love capturing the essence of a person or a moment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, I found work as a set photographer and production assistant at the 
executive production firm Mamma Team in Barcelona and thrived in the busy environment 
of advertising and fashion.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2017, I relocated from Barcelona to Bath to study 
Creative Writing and continue to work as a freelance photographer. 
Recently I have most enjoyed shooting outdoor portraits and pets!</p>

            <p>I was born in Germany and raised in Spain; two places so different, 
they set you up for a life of trying-to-find-yourself.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Growing up I spent a lot of time in nature; around lakes and rivers, 
pine forests and seashores. My childhood smells of wet leather, 
horses and bedtime stories by an open fire. Anti-mosquito candles, too.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I allowed myself to be overwhelmed by Barcelona and rescued a 
French Bulldog puppy named Sheldon. I left advertising to move to England and 
pursue Creative Writing and ended up rediscovering my love for photography. 
I made friends and lost some on the way, learned that parents are people too 
and that marmite really is controversial. I grew into the beginnings of who I 
might want to be.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I like to think of my photography as something that captures 
the innocent magic of country living, but also pays whimsical homage to the 
glitzy-grunge of cityscapes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Perhaps this is where I’m comfortable; 
somewhere between the silent comfort of undisturbed birdsongs and the exciting 
rumble of skateboards at 5 am. Somewhere, in between.</p>
